pdf-operator
============
pdf operating tools for easily handle pdf books.

Booklet maker
============

First you should install python 2.7 and pyPdf module.

I recommand using briss to crop first, then use this tool to rearrange page number.

It's a beta version, it was tested on some pdf books.

odd,4M,4M+2 pages can be adapted automatically, all you need to do is use this tool directly.

Usage: booklet.py InputPDFFile
